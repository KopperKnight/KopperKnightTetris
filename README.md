# KopperKnightTetris
Tetris written from scratch by Kopper Knight to review and refine my Object Oriented Skills and the latest ide tools. A tertiary goal is to create a simple game that is not overly complicated but simply elegant and simple and functional.

This directory is the project directory in eclipse (as well as the repository on github) as such a zip of this repository can be imported into eclipse using its project import feature.

For those that want to compile it on windows, all you need to do is run the batch files in order to compile the source.
Java 8+ is required to compile to class files correctly using the batch scripts.
Java 11+ is required to create a runnable jar file.

In any case, the Java executable must be in your Window's OS PATH environment variable for the batch scripts to work.

This repository was developed using Oracle Java 11 from oracle at:    https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html
Oracle java is the propreitary version and can be freely downloaded, but requires users to register using an email and password. Registration is free.

Alternatively, https://adoptopenjdk.net/ has prebuilt open source java 11 platform installs for users not interested in registering with oracle. The non-proprietary opensource java platform is nearly identical in every way anyways.


Will work on ANT and Gradle build scripts in coming days, as well as javadocs documentation. Also exploring github.io side of the site and if I will setup a complementory webpage there for this too. Stay tuned....
